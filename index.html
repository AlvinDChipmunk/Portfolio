                    <p>Welcome to Alvin Revilas' professional portfolio website. I will feature here website projects and other items that I wish for future employers and co workers to examine, so they have a good understanding of my skills and capabilities.</p>
                    <p>I am currently enrolled in a web development boot camp, to refresh my website coding skills. Other skills and experiences I have include programming in other languages. Below is an abbreviated list:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</dt>
                        <dd>These are the main topics in the development bootcamp I am in. We cover many aspects of full stack development, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Server side technologies, like Node and Express</li>
                                <li>Databases such as MySQL and Mongo</li>
                                <li>Differing ways of applying JavaScript including DOM manipulation, jQuery, Handlebars, and React</li>
                            </ul>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>MySQL: (Job Experience)</dt>
                        <dd>Last significant experience dealt with the "Combat Pilot" MMO game project of ThunderHawk Studios, a subsidiary of Mad Catz. I was the game's database admin, running MySQL.</dd>
                        <dt>C#:</dt>
                        <dd>Most recent experiences dealt with game creation in Unity. Other instances include using Microsoft' XNA library to create a 3rd person shooter game with mechanics similar to the classic "1941" game and utilizing artistic design
                            emulating a 1980's TV show "Airwolf".
                            <ul>
                                <li>A zipped folder containing this game project is available for <a class="myNav" href="./assets/Fanwoolf _Game_zip.zip">direct download here. (Fanwoolf _Game_zip.zip)</a> It runs on Windows machines, and might ask to download
                                    XNA. There might be a security issue, because the "unknown publisher" is me, not any formal software company. So, my software should be safe to install and run. Having an XBox controller plugged into a USB port on your
                                    computer, before playing the game, is highly recommended.

                                <li>GitHub repo for this project, the "FanWoolf Demo Game", may be found here: <a href="https://github.com/AlvinDChipmunk/FanWoolf">https://github.com/AlvinDChipmunk/FanWoolf</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>C, C++:</dt>
                        <dd>Most recent experiences dealt with game creation in the Unreal engine. Other instances of use include a primitive compiler project written in C, and demonstrating simple software architecture, in C++, to a SDSU student video game
                            creation club. Some previous college coursework in C++ became preparatory work for explorations into WebGL.</dd>
                        <dt>PHP:</dt>
                        <dd>Webpage form processing is the bulk of that type of experience</dd>
